Though little, the town was far from ordinary. Not only was it home to a coterie of curious cats, Whiskerton abided by the laws of quantum physics. That’s why its feline residents loved it so dearly. Who wouldn’t want to live in a place where feathers spontaneously appeared and ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Chapter 1 Part 2 - Commentary - Introduction to Quantum Computing</title><link href="https://quantumkittens.online/posts/CHAPTER-1-Part-2-Introduction-to-Quantum-Computing/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Chapter 1 Part 2 - Commentary - Introduction to Quantum Computing" /><published>2022-06-14T00:00:00+00:00</published> <updated>2022-07-19T08:15:51+00:00</updated> <id>https://quantumkittens.online/posts/CHAPTER-1-Part-2-Introduction-to-Quantum-Computing/</id> <content src="https://quantumkittens.online/posts/CHAPTER-1-Part-2-Introduction-to-Quantum-Computing/" /> <author> <name>Radha Pyari Sandhir</name> </author> <summary> Ours is a world governed by classical physics, in which a film is either playing or paused, a coin lands on either heads or tails, and a cat is either alive or dead. Classical physics is what we experience in our everyday lives. Based on the trajectory and velocity of a ball you’ve thrown, it’s pretty easy to predict with reasonable certainty where the ball will land–depending on your aiming sk... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Chapter 2 - Story - Schrödinger Day</title><link href="https://quantumkittens.online/posts/CHAPTER-2-Story-Schr%C3%B6dinger-Day/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Chapter 2 - Story - Schrödinger Day" /><published>2022-06-13T00:00:00+00:00</published> <updated>2022-07-27T16:12:56+00:00</updated> <id>https://quantumkittens.online/posts/CHAPTER-2-Story-Schr%C3%B6dinger-Day/</id> <content src="https://quantumkittens.online/posts/CHAPTER-2-Story-Schr%C3%B6dinger-Day/" /> <author> <name>Radha Pyari Sandhir</name> </author> <summary> “Twisted yarn,” Arya cursed as she examined the Town Hall’s pantry. It was Schrödinger Day, Whiskerton’s most joyous festival, and the councilcat—with pristine ginger coat, green eyes, and a penchant for sunbathing—found herself in somewhat of a quandary. Schrödinger Day was the anniversary of Whiskerton becoming a town. The townscats always celebrated their Foundation Day with much pomp and g... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Chapter 2 Part 2 - Commentary - Qubits, Superposition, and Measurement</title><link href="https://quantumkittens.online/posts/CHAPTER-2-Part-2-Qubits-Superposition-and-Measurements/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Chapter 2 Part 2 - Commentary - Qubits, Superposition, and Measurement" /><published>2022-06-12T00:00:00+00:00</published> <updated>2024-11-15T19:54:03+00:00</updated> <id>https://quantumkittens.online/posts/CHAPTER-2-Part-2-Qubits-Superposition-and-Measurements/</id> <content src="https://quantumkittens.online/posts/CHAPTER-2-Part-2-Qubits-Superposition-and-Measurements/" /> <author> <name>Radha Pyari Sandhir</name> </author> <summary> You very likely know what classical computing is; it’s what most people mean when they say “computing”. This is the computing done by everyday electronic gadgets like the device you’re using to read this, and even the computing done by supercomputers tucked away in labs. Deep down at the fundamental level of a classical computer, information is carried by bits: single units of information that... </summary> </entry> </feed>
