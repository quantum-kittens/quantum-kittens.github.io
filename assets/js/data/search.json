Though little, the town was far from ordinary. Not only was it home to a coterie of curious cats, Whiskerton abided by the laws of quantum physics.That’s why its feline residents loved it so dearly. Who wouldn’t want to live in a place where feathers spontaneously appeared and disappeared? Or where marbles could be red and blue at the same time? Or where one could not tell with certainty where a felt mouse would land if one tossed it in the air; only where it probably might but quite likely not end up?Whiskerton was a town governed by probabilities, monumentally different from its neighbor, Pawville. Pawville with its proud canine populace, where every outcome was easily predicted with certainty. The dogs were thrilled that nothing extraordinary ever happened there. The cats hated it for precisely that reason.No, Whiskerton was where they belonged, with its impossibilities and improbabilities and counterintuitivities. Oh: and tuna biscuits, of course.At the heart of Whiskerton lay its town square, wherein sat a striking feline statue of copper, brass, and gold. While it was positioned under the Great Scratching Tree—a considerable oak with more scratch than bark—the warm shadows cast by branches did not diminish the statue’s strikingness but rather enhanced its tender detailing.The statue bore the likeness of Schrödinger, Founder of Whiskerton, gleaming face crinkled in thought as though he contemplated gravely important things, and waistcoat stretched a tad thin around the midriff, betraying a weakness for tuna biscuits with evening cream.Schrödinger had been an enthusiastic pioneer in spite of his tuna biscuit addiction, prone to wander in the hopes of discovering something magnificent. And discover something magnificent he did! A land that was…peculiar, to say the least. Quite unlike any he’d seen before.The grass was not only green, but also purple and blue, for one. For another, the hills and trees and ponds were prone to shift about every so often, as though they couldn’t quite pick their favorite spots. But the best part about this land? There were toys. Lots and lots of toys: marbles and feathers and felt mice and more, all as wondrous and peculiar as the land itself, shifting colors, periodically disappearing, moving in ways that were difficult to predict.An extraordinary land; perfect for an extraordinary town, Schrödinger is believed to have thought while munching on a tuna biscuit, eyes grazing the curious landscape.To establish this extraordinary new town, Schrödinger lured potential denizens with grand shows involving the toys native to the land. Hundreds of animals of all shapes, sizes, and ornamentations showed up to spectate. They hitched tents, bonded over campfires, oohed and aahed at the theatrics, and enjoyed (for the most part) waking up to their tents somehow unexpectedly having popped to a different location within the encampment overnight.The animals were thoroughly entertained, but it was only the cats who expressed interest in taking up permanent residence in this shiny new land, curious creatures as they were. At the end of the day, non-felines much preferred to live in a place where they could clearly see where and how the toys they loved to toss around moved, thankyouverymuch.And so it was that on the fourteenth of April that year, Whiskerton was not only pronounced a town, but declared homeland for all the cats in the world.Chapter 1 Part 2 - Commentary - IntroductionChapter 2 - Story - Schrödinger Day" }, { "title": "Chapter 1 Part 2 - Commentary - Introduction to Quantum Computing", "url": "/posts/CHAPTER-1-Part-2-Introduction-to-Quantum-Computing/", "categories": "", "tags": "", "date": "2022-06-14 00:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "Ours is a world governed by classical physics, in which a film is either playing or paused, a coin lands on either heads or tails, and a cat is either alive or dead. Classical physics is what we experience in our everyday lives. Based on the trajectory and velocity of a ball you’ve thrown, it’s pretty easy to predict with reasonable certainty where the ball will land–depending on your aiming skills, it may not land where you intended it to, of course, but once it’s left your hand, you can deduce where it is headed. There’s zero chance of it landing at your feet, say, if you’ve thrown it with enough force.However, if you were to shrink down–and I mean really shrink down–you’ll fast discover that the laws that govern the subatomic world are much different from what we experience on a macroscopic scale. Down there, throwing a ball would look very different.The subatomic world is the domain of quantum physics, where results are governed by probabilities.1 Outcomes that wouldn’t have been likely in the classical context would suddenly be possible. The ball could very well land at your feet no matter how hard you throw it! You and the ball would be subatomic particles, like electrons, and hence governed by the laws of quantum physics.What makes quantum physics so bizarre and, in a way, counterintuitive, is that there are certain quantum phenomena that have no counterpart in classical physics. Quantum particles can be in a superposition of more than one state, they can be entangled, and there are uncertainties associated with their behaviors. There is nothing that we experience in our classical world that is analogous to any of these properties!The extraordinary, counterintuitive properties of quantum particles can be harnessed for computing in ways that the digital devices we use every day, or “classical computers”, simply cannot. Quantum computing, we call it. Quantum computing differs as a computing system from classical computing because of the way it employs the fundamental laws of nature.And the difference has enormous potential: it is widely believed that near future quantum computers that work perfectly may be able to solve certain problems that even today’s most powerful supercomputers cannot. Problems like handling monumental amounts of data, simulating complex molecules to discover new drugs, materials, and chemical processes, and prime factorization of very large numbers.We still are a ways away from reaching this ideal quantum computer that works perfectly and seeing this potential realized; there are a number of hardware obstacles to overcome. But imperfect quantum computers already exist today, some even publicly accessible through the cloud, and researchers and industry professionals alike are working to identify near-term useful applications and evolve the hardware.At this point, it is important to note that quantum computers won’t replace our classical computers; only complement them by extending the realm of computing possibilities. We don’t need quantum computers to binge-watch tv shows when we can do so perfectly with our own devices. We need them for things classical computers aren’t very good at!Illustrated in the stories ahead are various important quantum phenomena and how they are used for quantum computing.Let’s venture together to Whiskerton, now, shall we?Chapter 2 - Story - Schrödinger Day While quantum physics is prevalent at the subatomic, microscopic level, there are some processes that display quantum effects even at the macroscopic level. But not really things we encounter as we go about our daily lives. &#8617; " }, { "title": "Chapter 2 - Story - Schrödinger Day", "url": "/posts/CHAPTER-2-Story-Schr%C3%B6dinger-Day/", "categories": "", "tags": "", "date": "2022-06-13 00:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "“Twisted yarn,” Arya cursed as she examined the Town Hall’s pantry. It was Schrödinger Day, Whiskerton’s most joyous festival, and the councilcat—with pristine ginger coat, green eyes, and a penchant for sunbathing—found herself in somewhat of a quandary.Schrödinger Day was the anniversary of Whiskerton becoming a town. The townscats always celebrated their Foundation Day with much pomp and grandeur, even umpteen generations later when Arya, the councilcat in charge of planning, found herself staring at the pantry’s contents.You see, she had diligently instructed the Town Hall’s chefcat to bake tuna biscuits, which were the obvious choice of celebratory snack for this occasion’s evening cream. But that morning, a frantic chefcat reported that all the tuna biscuits she’d spent the entire night preparing had vanished. And no, it wasn’t the town’s mischievous kittens who ate them. The tuna biscuits disappeared before her very eyes!Vanishing items weren’t an uncommon occurrence in Whiskerton–though, to be fair, food hardly ever disappeared–and Arya figured the tuna biscuits would turn up again sooner or later. But she couldn’t count on them returning in time.And so, after shoving her panic to the back of her mind where she commanded it to ‘stay’ pending further instruction, Arya took the matter of celebratory snack into her own paws by examining the pantry for other options. But when she saw its contents, the panic threatened to break free. No, no, Schrödinger Day cannot be ruined!There were only two snack options available: cheese ribbons or salmon shortcakes. And herein lay the problem: while cats were curious and enterprising creatures, they were also awful sticklers for tradition, especially when it came to Schrödinger. And on Schrödinger ’s Day, only ever one snack was served with evening cream.But with just these two options available for the single celebratory snack, Arya was faced with an unfortunate choice. The townscats were evenly divided in their love for these particular snacks; either choice would result in half of them being disappointed. And Arya always avoided disappointing anyone if she could help it.Cheese ribbons. No, can’t choose that, poor Jinxy one street over will end up hiccuping for days. Okay, salmon shortcakes, then. No, I’ll never hear the end of it from Blade. Fine, cheese ribbons. Oh, but Billito will box my ears at our next council meeting! But…if I choose salmon shortcakes, Poh will box my ears at our next council meeting!Arya’s thoughts raced hither and thither, threatening to implode, panic rearing its wretched head. She eventually realized she could either stay there, paralyzed by her thoughts, or she could cat up and make a decision. So, make a decision it was, but she would do so by consulting a marble. Marbles could be helpful when faced with a difficult choice between two equally weighted options.She went to her office within Town Hall, a cozy room that bore an abundance of books, smells of fresh ink and parchment, and sunbathing spots. And a marble or two.Whiskertese marbles had a curious property: they were red and blue at the same time, a superposition of two colors, until someone looked directly at them. When directly observed, a Whiskertese marble would either turn red or turn blue, with a fifty percent chance of either color. Should one pack a room with a hundred Whiskertese marbles, and thereafter look directly at each individual marble, close to half would turn red and close to half would turn blue. There was no way to tell beforehand which of the two colors a marble would become. Arya pawed one of the marbles out of a storage box, careful to avoid looking at it directly.“If it turns blue, I will choose cheese ribbons. If it turns red, I will choose salmon shortcakes,” she declared aloud to her office’s occupants: giant piles of books and paper, half very important bureaucratic documents, half napping perches.But, alas, Arya never got her answer, for just as she was about to observe the marble, a commotion outside her window snatched her attention. And what she saw when she bounded over to the window unleashed her panic in all its glory. For in clear view was the town square, the statue of Schrödinger, all the props, tables, and decorations the adult townscats had meticulously assembled for the festivities, and: a band of excitable kittens tearing through everything.They headed straight for the statue. Arya leaped out the window and hastened after them.“No, no! Halt, kits!” Arya chastised, struggling to maintain the appearance of calm—at the end of the day she was a rather gentle cat, and it wouldn’t do to lose her temper on Schrödinger Day, now would it? “You were given strict instructions to stay aw…” But she trailed off when it was evident they were deaf to her admonishments; something else had captured their attention. She followed their collective gaze upward to the branches of the Great Scratching Tree. And then blew an exasperated huff between her teeth.Luna.Luna, Luna, Luna. While the townskittens had been instructed to steer clear of the preparations until just before the celebration, she should have known to keep Luna in particular occupied far away from the square. For up in the now-shredded streamers of the Tree, extending a raring paw toward a purple feather that had popped into existence right above the statue, was the town’s most mischievous, excitable, and destructive kitten of all: Luna.Technically, Luna was a tad old to be called ‘kitten’, but she was small for her almost-ready-to-be-an-adult-cat age. Her expression was permanently that of raised eyebrows, had she eyebrows at all, which could be interpreted as wonder or concern, contingent upon the circumstances. Her fur was short and ginger, prone to a slight grunge since her insatiable curiosity left her easily distracted during a bath.Luna teetered on the edge of a branch, hanging close to the statue. Hanging precariously close to the decorative contraption that was the most important part of the occasion, more so than the celebratory snack: a glitter machine atop Schrödinger’s hat.You see, the townscats of Whiskerton enjoyed uncertainty. They also enjoyed shiny things. Each year, as a signal to commence the Foundation Day celebrations, a flurry of glitter was released over the statue.The glitter machine consisted of a single marble connected to two glitter vials. During the opening ceremony, a designated councilcat looked directly at the marble. The marble turned either red or blue, and one of the vials would pop open depending on the marble’s color, showering colored glitter on their town’s beloved founder. In the days leading up to the holiday, the townscats greatly enjoyed debating which of the two colors would be released. This year, a green glitter vial was linked to the marble’s red, and a purple glitter vial was linked to the marble’s blue.Forget the evening snack; if Luna damaged the glitter machine, the celebrations would be ruined. Arya shouted to Luna, but of course, at that moment, Luna’s whole world consisted solely of the purple feather. There was no room for admonishments, glitter machines, or even other cats.Arya scanned the area for something to lure Luna away, for she feared tipping the kitten off the branch if she attempted to climb the tree herself.Her eyes fell on a familiar assortment of tools scattered around an open toolbox by the statue’s pedestal. It was as if a buildercat had abruptly abandoned his task for a nap or a bath. She knew exactly to whom that toolbox belonged.“Blade?” Arya called, hoping her best friend would hear her, wherever he was.Blade was an agile black cat with blazing yellow eyes, skilled with marbles and tools, and even more skilled at being easily startled. Unsurprisingly, the sudden echo of his name off the buildings that lined the square provoked a monumental leap into the air, back arched. Where had he been? Curled up, fast asleep, tucked under a bush, dreaming of pigeons.Blade’s protests at his nap’s interruption ceased instantly when he spotted Luna. He scampered to join Arya and the kittens at the foot of the tree, calling to the maddening rascal about how hard he worked on that glitter machine and that she should come down if she knew what was good for her.It didn’t work, of course.The cats scrambled for ideas, and even the kittens around them chimed in excitedly.“Do you think we can distract her with another feather?” Arya said.“I haven’t seen another pop up around here for a few hours,” Blade said.“How about tossing up a ball?” one of the kittens piped in.“Or a felt mouse?” said another.“We would not be able to guarantee that it would head in Luna’s direction,” Arya replied, not unkindly.But it turns out their ponderances were in vain, for a series of rather unfortunate events occured:First, Luna lost her balance, tumbling head-first towards the feather.Then, her tail whipped around, headed straight for the glitter machine.Blade noticed Luna losing balance and jumped, hoping to intercept her before she hit the glitter machine. Unfortunately, Blade cannot jump very high unless he is startled, and thus, did not make it even remotely close to the kitten.Luna’s tail hit the machine.Machine, kitten, feather plummeted as one, snapping up the cat on the way down.Luna landed on her feet, feather proudly clamped between her teeth. One look at Arya’s face set her darting away to inspect her prize.But Blade?Poor Blade had landed in his own toolbox, along with the glitter machine. The lid of the box clapped shut over his head.Arya blinked. The kittens blinked.Even though dread about ruined celebrations coursed through Arya, reflexive excitement began to stir in her gut, and it was evident that she wasn’t alone: the kittens whispered and shuffled their feet buoyantly.For what they had before them was a glorious uncertainty. A cat inside a box, and with him the glitter machine! The machine had likely been set off by the fall, which meant Blade could be swathed in purple glitter. Or he could be green. No one could be sure until they looked. Just like a Whiskertese marble. What a magnificent conundrum!Whispers turned to impassioned shouts of color guesses, and an enlivened crowd coalesced in the square as word spread through the town like wildfire. Arya could hear Blade’s muffled mutterings about interrupted naps and useless kittens and inconsequential feathers as he attempted to push open the lid, but she couldn’t have any of that, now, could she? For as she gazed at the enthused gathering cats, she realized Schrödinger Day wasn’t ruined at all! This novel uncertainty was too captivating.She hopped lightly onto the lid so that Blade couldn’t leave. His mutterings grew louder, and this time “obnoxious best friends” were added to his list.Oh, she would let him out eventually, of course, and even slip him extra snack portions for being such a good sport, but she’d let the townscats have their fun first.“Listen up,” she called out. “I have a proposal for you, my dear cats. Let our celebratory snack be decided by the color of Blade’s coat. Green for cheese ribbons, purple for salmon shortcakes. What say?”And, to Arya’s delight, not a single cat objected.(Well, except for Blade.)Chapter 2 Part 2 - Commentary - Qubits, Superposition, and MeasurementChapter 3 - Story - Doorbells" }, { "title": "Chapter 2 Part 2 - Commentary - Qubits, Superposition, and Measurement", "url": "/posts/CHAPTER-2-Part-2-Qubits-Superposition-and-Measurements/", "categories": "", "tags": "", "date": "2022-06-12 00:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "You very likely know what classical computing is; it’s what most people mean when they say “computing”. This is the computing done by everyday electronic gadgets like the device you’re using to read this, and even the computing done by supercomputers tucked away in labs.Deep down at the fundamental level of a classical computer, information is carried by bits: single units of information that can have only one of two values or states: 0 or 1. In much the same way, quantum computers have a fundamental computing unit, called quantum bits or qubits. Here’s a fun fact: the marbles of Whiskerton actually represent qubits!What is a Qubit?A qubit is the simplest system in quantum computing, the fundamental building block for quantum computation. Physically, qubits can take a number of different forms, depending on the hardware a quantum computer uses. But, behaviorally, they act the same way. So you can consider a ‘qubit’ to be an abstract mathematical object that behaves in a curious manner different from a classical bit. Classical bits can take on one of two values, 0 and 1, but a qubit can do that and more: Qubits are abstract mathematical objects that have the ability to not only be in the states 0 or 1, but in a superposition of the two.Quantum SuperpositionQuantum superposition is a neat quantum physics phenomenon that doesn’t really have an analog in classical physics. You can think of it as a combination.Where classical bits can only ever be in state 0 or 1 and never a combination of the two, quantum states can be combined and still be valid states. So the state of a qubit can be a combination of 0 and 1. In Whiskerton, the marbles are by default in such a superposition state: an equally weighted combination of the colors red and blue. It would be incorrect to think of these colors as paint colors. In your everyday, classical experience, if you combine red and blue paint, you would get purple paint. But Whiskertese marbles aren’t actually purple; after a cat directly observes a marble, the color can turn either red or blue, with a fifty percent chance for each. You definitely cannot get the colors red or blue back if you have purple paint!Being able to make use of this wondrous phenomenon is one of the ways quantum computing differs from classical computing. In a classical computer, if you perform an operation on a bit, you’re essentially performing that operation on either a 0 or 1, one at a time. If you need to perform an operation on both, you’d have to do so in two shots, consecutively.But by harnessing superposition, a quantum computer could perform that operation on both 0 and 1 at the same time. If we scale this up to many qubits, you can imagine how this may potentially result in speed-ups or an increase in memory capacity or other improvements.MeasurementsYou’ve seen that the marbles have a fifty percent chance of becoming red or blue upon direct observation. A cat observing a marble is a metaphor of measuring a qubit’s state, where red represents a 1 and blue represents a 0. In real life, measurements are conducted by measuring physical quantities in the lab.Measurement is essentially asking the qubit what state it’s in, but there’s a caveat: simply the act of measurement makes the qubit settle into either the 0 or 1 states, so you only ever get the answer 0 or 1. But there’s a probability associated with each possible outcome.Even if you happen to know everything about the probabilities beforehand–that is, even if you know the exact superposition state of the qubit before measurement–you cannot predict the outcome of a measurement.Essentially: Even if you know everything about the state of a quantum system, it can still behave randomly.For instance, you know everything about the state of a Whiskertese marble: it’s in an equally weighted (fifty-fifty) superposition. Yet, after measurement, we don’t know if it will end up as a red marble or a blue one. That part is random!Quantum physics is probabilistic, which means there is some uncertainty. A measurement moves the system from uncertainty to certainty.At first glance, it may appear that the benefit of quantum superposition has vanished since you only ever get 0’s and 1’s as your outcomes, no different from classical bits. Enter quantum computing algorithms.An algorithm is basically a series of operations you perform to get a desired result. What a quantum computing algorithm does is manipulate the probabilities, increasing the probability associated with the desired outcome and decreasing all others. 1 In this way, if the probability associated with the desired state hits 1, then that outcome is guaranteed, which means the behavior is no longer random.So there you have it. Now that you have an overview of qubits, quantum superposition, and measurements, you know the physics behind the marbles in Whiskerton. If you’d like to dive deeper into these concepts and see how Blade’s predicament is related to what is known as Schrödinger’s cat, read on! Otherwise, head on over to the next story: Chapter 3 - Story - DoorbellsMathematical Representation of a Qubit StateQuantum states are mathematically represented by what is known as Dirac notation, which makes use of something called a ket: $\\ket{}$2.This is how an arbitrary qubit state is represented3:\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:qubit}\\ket{\\psi}=\\alpha_{0}\\ket{0}+\\alpha_{1}\\ket{1}\\end{equation}The Greek letter $\\psi$, pronounced “sigh”, is a symbolic representation of the state. The $\\ket{}$ symbol is written, not spoken. When you refer to the qubit, you can voice, “I have a qubit in the state psi,” or write, “I have a qubit in the state $\\ket{\\psi}$,” after having defined $\\ket{\\psi}$ in an equation.Notice that $\\psi$ isn’t the only thing tucked within a ket. You have $\\ket{0}$ and $\\ket{1}$ in the equation as well, which are the 0 and 1 states. These are called the basis states of the qubits; that is, the possible states a qubit can reduce to after measurement, just as a Whiskertese marble can reduce to a red or a blue. Since a qubit has two basis states, a qubit is a two-level system.The plus sign indicates a combination, or a superposition. The parameters $\\alpha_{0}$ and $\\alpha_{1}$ are called amplitudes, and let us know how likely it is the qubit will be in the state $\\ket{0}$ or $\\ket{1}$ after measurement, where $\\alpha$ is the Greek letter, alpha. The subscript of the symbol $\\alpha$ is a label to indicate to which basis state it corresponds.Mathematically, if we square the amplitudes, we’ll get the probabilities associated with each basis state. So, if you measure a qubit in the state $\\ket{\\psi}$, you will get the result 0 with a probability $\\alpha_{0}^2$, or get the result 1 with a probability $\\alpha_{1}^2$. 4You may rightfully be wondering why these squares are suddenly popping into the picture. It is simply a mathematical convention that reminds us the amplitudes $\\alpha_{0}$ and $\\alpha_{1}$ may be negative. The squares of each of these amplitudes are probabilities, and probabilities are always positive, as are squares!This means that each quantum state is subject to a constraint. Probability theory has a strict rule: all probabilities should add up to 1, so $\\alpha_{0}^2+\\alpha_{1}^2=1$ always.Let’s look at a specific example. Suppose we have a qubit in the state:\\begin{equation}\\ket{\\psi}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}\\ket{0}-\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3}}\\ket{1}\\end{equation}Here, $\\alpha_{0}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}$, which means the probability of getting the result 0 after measurement is $\\frac{2}{3}$. Similarly for $\\alpha_{1}=-\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3}}$, and a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$ associated with result 1. That is, if you have a ton of qubits in this state, and you measure them all, statistically speaking, approximately one third of them would yield the outcome 1. The larger the amplitude, $\\alpha$, the higher the probability, and the more likely it is to find the qubit in the associated state after measurement.5A Note on StatisticsThe thing about qubits is that you cannot determine $\\alpha_{0}$ and $\\alpha_{1}$ for an arbitrary state $\\ket{\\psi}$ through measurements–the only way to know exactly what numbers these $\\alpha$’s are is to have created the state yourself, or to know the person who created it. This is because a measurement always results in a single outcome: 0 or 1, so no measurement can lead to the knowledge of the $\\alpha$’s. If someone else created the state, you can ask them for thousands of qubits in identical states and after thousands of measurements, statistically decipher what the amplitudes and thus the probabilities of the state are. 6However, you don’t necessarily need to know what the $\\alpha$’s are in order for qubit states to be useful. The beauty of the qubit state lies in how one can change and manipulate $\\alpha_{0}$ and $\\alpha_{1}$ with quantum gates before measurement. As mentioned earlier, the goal is to boost the probabilities associated with the desired outcome. If the desired outcome is 0, then the algorithm can be designed to boost $\\alpha_{0}$, regardless of what it is. And if $\\alpha_{0} = 1$, then the outcome 0 will be guaranteed.Physical QubitsAs stated earlier, qubit states are mathematical constructs, which make them easier to work with mathematically to develop algorithms and the like without making a statement on the physical system that is used. This is important, because it doesn’t matter whether you physically construct qubit states in the lab as, say, electron spins, polarized states of photons, or something else.Don’t know what electrons or photons are? Let’s digress briefly: An electron is a negatively charged subatomic particle. It has a property called ‘spin’ that we needn’t discuss in detail. Suffice it to say that the spin of an electron can be $+\\frac{1}{2}$ or $-\\frac{1}{2}$, which mathematically can be represented as the states $\\ket{0}$ and $\\ket{1}$. A photon is the building block of electromagnetic radiation, which includes visible light. Everything that you see is due to these photons hitting your retinae. When photons are polarized, they vibrate in a specific direction rather than all directions. In terms of qubits, polarization in the horizontal direction, say, can be represented by $\\ket{0}$ and polarization in the vertical direction, say, can be represented by $\\ket{1}$. A superposition of the two is possible, and corresponds to the photon vibrating in a direction between vertical and horizontal, analogous to Southeast lying between South and East on a compass.One important thing to note about qubit states is that they are not stable. Little disturbances in a qubit’s environment can reduce it to either $\\ket{0}$ or $\\ket{1}$: disturbances like heat, vibrations, etc.7 And even that is unstable; after some time a qubit can jump back into a superposition. It’s this little tug of war of states that makes qubits a little tricky to manipulate in the lab–and what keeps the cats of Whiskerton intrigued!Schrödinger’s CatThis brings us to Blade in the box with the glitter machine. His predicament is a homage of sorts to a thought experiment by physicist Erwin Schrödinger in 19358.Qubits are two-level systems and have two basis states, but there are other quantum particles and systems that can have even more. Yet all of these systems, qubits and beyond, adhere to the same rule: upon measurement, the outcome is only one out of all the possibilities.No one really knows why this happens. One possible explanation is the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, in which the act of measurement itself collapses all possibilities to a single one. In 1935, physicist Erwin Schrödinger published a paper that outlined his famous thought experiment as a push-back to this interpretation, by hypothetically extrapolating quantum effects on a microscopic level to an everyday macroscopic object: a cat.In the original thought experiment, a radioactive substance is used instead of a qubit (or a Whiskertese marble). Radioactive substances decay according to probabilities, just like a qubit reduces to a certain state according to probabilities.A cat is placed in a box with a radioactive substance that is linked to a vial of poison. If any one of the atoms decays, then the vial shatters, poisoning the cat. Thus, the state of the cat is coupled with that of the poison system, which is governed by the probability that at least one atom will decay. In this way, before the box is opened, the cat can be considered to be both dead or alive, because each of the possibilities is likely. That is, the cat’s reality is undetermined prior to the opening of the box.Schrödinger argued that this is a ‘ridiculous case’ and that one can’t really believe that before one opens the box the cat is in a superposition of dead and alive. He was right, of course. This scenario can’t be considered truly quantum. The cat isn’t a quantum particle, for one. So while the cat isn’t actually in a superposition of dead and alive, the thought experiment at the very least demonstrates a probabilistic system.This thought experiment has fast become one of the most recognized iconographies of quantum phenomenon in popular culture, and naturally had to make an appearance in Whiskerton. With glitter, of course, because there’s no reason to get morbid in such a quaint little town. Note that Schrödinger didn’t actually poison cats–he merely thought about it!Now, there’s one more curious aspect to this thought experiment: you could say that the state of the cat is entangled with that of the radioactive substance.Quantum entanglement is actually our next stop!

Quantum operations are carried out by applying what are known as quantum gates, logic operations that are the building block of quantum circuits, and analogous to classical logic gates in conventional digital circuits. &#8617; A ket denotes a mathematical object with certain properties called a vector. A qubit can be considered a vector. Two vectors can be combined to form another valid vector. But you don’t need to know about vectors to read this text. &#8617; Disclaimer: This equation is not the complete picture of a qubit; there’s a degree of freedom called ‘phase’ that can be useful for computation but is beyond the scope of this text. &#8617; The superscript 2 indicates a ‘square’, which means the number is being multiplied by itself. That is, $\\alpha_{0}^2=\\alpha_{0}*\\alpha_{0}$. &#8617; Note for the mathematicians: we refer to $mod(\\alpha)$ here. &#8617; This is precisely why quantum circuits are run multiple times: to gather statistics. Quantum circuits are quantum computation models that have gate sequences, measurements, and the like. &#8617; This sensitivity of quantum states is one of the obstacles in fabricating stable, perfect physical qubits, and devices with a large number of qubits.

Arya, for instance, preferred sunbathing spots with a twinge of sponginess to them, like a hard pillow or a stack of papers. If a spot didn’t meet her standards, she’d dispel a tragic sigh. There was a cat named Mowgli who took his bird watching seriously—he was known to yawp at anyone who dared talk while his eyes followed the feathered creatures’ movements. Another cat, Poh, would yawp at anyone who didn’t talk to him while he watched birds.Luna’s particular quirk was to begin each day with something that captivated her, something that kept boredom at bay, something that made her wiggle with glee. On most days, that meant darting about the town to identify changes made overnight; the town of Whiskerton would occasionally rearrange itself at night, unbeknownst to anyone until the morning after, save for the occasional cat on a midnight stroll.Each morning before breakfast—since to her there were more important things than food—Luna would zoom through the streets to discover changes. Blinded by curiosity and sprinting far more quickly than she had any business to, she’d bump into hawker carts and morning walkers and mail deliverers, drawing curses in her wake.On this specific morning, Luna found, much to her chagrin, that the streets and trees and rocks and grass had decided to stay exactly where they were. Not one to stay chagrined or bored or otherwise unoccupied for long, she turned to her next favorite thing: pranks.And one prank that never got old was ringing doorbells.Specifically, ringing Blade’s doorbell, as he was a cat who startled easily. Whenever someone rang his doorbell, a bang! could be heard from somewhere within his cottage, for he’d leap high enough to hit the ceiling. Luna, along with any kittens accompanying her, would giggle, then bolt before Blade opened the door.Now, it wasn’t only Blade’s skittishness that made ringing his doorbell interesting. A Whiskertese doorbell was itself an entertaining contraption, being more extraordinary than an ordinary doorbell. The contraption had been Arya’s idea—she was clever at that sort of thing—and Blade, as her best friend, was clever at bringing Arya’s ideas to life.The Whiskertese doorbells were fabricated like so: two marbles were connected by something called an entangler, which, true to its name, entangled the marbles. This meant if someone looked directly at one marble, then the second marble would immediately be affected—without anyone having looked at it! Each of the two marbles would be in a superposition of red and blue, but once someone observed one of them, the two marbles would turn the same color: either both red, or both blue.An entangler was embedded into the front door of each home, and the two marbles were placed in compartments that hung on either side. The compartment on the outside had a peephole through which a visiting cat could observe the marble. This act would immediately affect its counterpart on the other side of the door. The second marble was connected to a sound box so that whenever it became a single color, the sound would go off.The adult townscats loved their doorbells, but the kittens loved them even more. Luna, especially, relished in how she could immediately change the state of a marble without having looked at it by gazing at another marble. And in how that change released a chiming sound to summon a cottage’s occupant.With doorbells and Blade and marvelous sounds foremost in her mind, Luna went in search of an accomplice. She happened upon Soya, a timid but curious black kitten with a white diamond on her chest, who adored rustling plastic and reclining on high perches. Soya was attempting to climb her way up the side of Town Hall for a bit of reclining when Luna found her.“Hihihi,” Luna called. “Up for some mischief, Soya?” Soya, being a kitten, was of course always up for some mischief. Not moments later, the two scurried towards a certain buildercat’s home.Unsuspecting Blade was in his kitchen, staring intently at a suspicious spot on his ceiling. He clutched a small parcel in a paw because he was supposed to be delivering a custom build to one of the townscats, but he couldn’t tear his eyes away from that spot. He just had to figure out what it was!Meanwhile, on the front porch, Luna nudged Soya to peer inside the bell compartment. The marble within turned blue, as did the marble on the other side of the door, and the doorbell rang.The sound was, unsurprisingly, accompanied by a loud bang! and a “Twisted yarn!” which launched the kittens into fits of giggles. True to his nature, Blade had leapt reflexively at the sudden peal, bopping his head on the ceiling. Unbeknownst to him, the suspicious spot had transferred itself to his forehead in the process. Transferred itself, because the suspicious spot was in reality a ladybug who had, in the spur of the moment, decided to test whether perching on a cat’s head was more fun than perching on a ceiling.Blade glared and grumbled—first at bopping his head and then at the now-blank ceiling—before heading to the front door.When he opened the door to an empty porch, he groaned. Infernal kittens, I bet it was them. Disturbing my suspicious spot scrutinization. Now I know how Mowgli feels when he watches birds.From where they hid behind a bush, Luna and Soya shared gleeful whispers and watched as the buildercat glared at the street before trudging back inside. Ringing Blade’s doorbell had been so much fun, they decided to have another go of it.“Let’s count to five and then ring again,” Luna said. Entanglers always took a few seconds to re-entangle the marbles once set off.Soya nodded, and began to count: “One.”“Two,” said Luna.“Eight.”“Butterfly!”“Where?”“There.”“Eee! Catch it, catch it! Left. No, right! Rightleft!”Luna attempted to snatch a glimmering butterfly from the air, Soya contributing unhelpful albeit enthusiastic remarks. They spent a few breezy moments like this before Luna remembered why they were there.“Wait,” Luna said. “Let’s ring the bell first and then catch it?”Soya saluted.They rang the doorbell once more; this time it was Luna who peered into the peephole. The marble turned red, and the ensuing bang! they heard from within delighted them so fiercely they forgot all about the butterfly.The ladybug, peeved by the sudden jolt, hopped back to the ceiling, concluding that cat heads were decidedly not ideal for perching after all. But Blade did not see the suspicious spot reappear above him, for he barreled to the front door, furious.He flung open the door, unsurprised to find no one there, and yowled into the mid-morning sunshine: “I know it’s you, Luna! You and whichever kittens you’ve roped into bothering me. Leave me alone or I’ll… I’ll…” he glanced at the parcel still clutched in his paw. “I’ll make you run an errand!”There was no answer, though he hadn’t really been expecting one. But he had a plan.He pretended, with inimitable dramatic flair, to close the door. He left it a smidge open, just enough for him to peep through.However, Luna, being somewhat of a connoisseur of plans and pranks, anticipated this, so she turned to Soya and said:“It’s your turn to ring the bell. Go up there! I’ll stand guard.” And when the diamond-chested, gullible kitten did just that, Luna slipped away, rapturous at this bonus prank, the sounds of a disgruntled cat berating a kitten fading behind her as she fled.Back on the porch, beration complete, Blade pushed his parcel into a regretful Soya’s paws and set her about making the delivery. Which meant he was completely free to ponder the suspicious spot in peace.Chapter 3 Part 2 - Commentary - Multiple Qubits, Entanglement, and Bell States" }, { "title": "Chapter 3 Part 2 - Commentary - Multiple Qubits, Entanglement, and Bell States", "url": "/posts/CHAPTER-3-Part-2-Multiple-Qubits-Entanglement-and-Bell-States/", "categories": "", "tags": "", "date": "2022-06-10 00:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "There isn’t much you can do with a single classical bit. Information processing and algorithms usually require more units of information. For instance, down at the machine level, an image on your social media feed is not represented by a single bit. It is represented by many bits, many 0’s and 1’s, long strings of bits, and it is those bit strings that are transmitted across the internet and processed by your devices.In a similar fashion, there isn’t much you can do with a single qubit, no matter how fancy a qubit may seem. In fact, the potential advantage of quantum computing over classical computing in certain contexts lies in being able to one day create processors with hundreds and maybe thousands of stable, perfect qubits.Therefore, most quantum computing protocols involve more than one qubit, the way the doorbells of Whiskerton involve more than one marble. Granted, the doorbells of Whiskerton are still very simple quantum systems with only two marbles, whereas some of the algorithms designed for future quantum computers involve loads more. Nonetheless, these doorbells illustrate something that even more complex protocols make use of: a quantum phenomenon that has no analog in the classical world, quantum entanglement.What is Quantum Entanglement?Quantum entanglement describes a peculiar connection or relationship between quantum systems. If two quantum systems are entangled, they are connected in such a way that their states cannot be described independently, and performing measurements on one system will affect the other, even if the second system isn’t nearby.In essence, the following is possible in the quantum world: Even if two qubits (or quantum systems) are too far apart to influence each other, they can still be correlated in such a way that tampering with one immediately affects the other.The two marbles in a Whiskertese doorbell are entangled. Remember that if one turns red, the second one does as well, even though the two are in separate boxes. No one needs to look directly at the second marble in order for it to reduce to a single color.This entanglement isn’t quite like the correlations we see in our everyday lives. In our classical world, if you have two marbles in an opaque bag, one red and one blue, and you pull out the blue one, you would know immediately that the red one was still in the bag. That’s classical correlation, the type of correlation we experience on the daily.However, quantum entanglement doesn’t behave like classical correlations. There are nuances to it that don’t translate to our everyday experience. For one, if the marbles were Whiskertese marbles, then they wouldn’t be a single color in the first place. The marble you pull out of the bag would be in a superposition until you looked at it. Only once the marble in your hand reduces to a single color would the marble in the bag change, even if the bag was taken far away from you. 1Since we’re talking about two entities immediately influencing one another despite distance between them, at this point you may rightfully wonder: does this mean we can send information faster than light? Unfortunately, the answer is no.The catch is that simply performing any old type of measurement won’t work—yes, there are different types of measurements! The varying types of measurements are beyond the scope of the current text, but suffice it to say that if you and a friend who lives far away share an entangled pair, then the type of measurement you perform on your part of the pair must be conveyed to your friend somehow. If your friend doesn’t know which type of measurement to perform on their part, they won’t be able to ‘see’ the expected result! So some sort of communication must take place, say, through a telephone call. Which…cannot happen faster than light. If you’d like to dive a little deeper into quantum entanglement, read on! Otherwise, head on over to the next page: Who Gets the Cardboard Box?.Mathematical Representation of Multi-Qubit StatesMultiple qubit states are represented in a similar manner to single qubit states. We’ll focus on two-qubit states since Whiskerton doorbells have two qubits, but the representation holds for even higher numbers.Recall the equation for an arbitrary single qubit state from Chapter 2:\\begin{equation}\\ket{\\psi}=\\alpha_{0}\\ket{0}+\\alpha_{1}\\ket{1}\\end{equation}In this equation, the basis states are analogous to the two values a classical bit can have: 0 and 1. And a qubit can be in a superposition of the two basis states.In order to understand how to represent a two-qubit state, let’s look at all the possible values of two classical bits. Two bits, combined, can have one of four values: 00, 01, 10, or 11. Just like the single qubit case, these four values correspond to four basis states. Two qubits can be in one of these four states or they can be in a superposition of these states! Therefore, an arbitrary two-qubit state can be represented by the following equation:\\begin{equation}\\ket{\\psi}=\\alpha_{00}\\ket{00}+\\alpha_{01}\\ket{01}+\\alpha_{10}\\ket{10}+\\alpha_{11}\\ket{11}\\end{equation}Just like the equation for a single qubit, $\\alpha_{00}^2$ is the probability that the two qubits will yield the outcome 00 after measurement. Similarly for the other three basis states. Once again, the laws of probability dictate that $\\alpha_{00}^2+\\alpha_{01}^2+\\alpha_{10}^2+\\alpha_{11}^2=1$.Entanglement and Bell StatesSimply having two qubits in hand is not enough to consider them entangled. The qubits have to be in specific states in order to be considered entangled, which means there are certain $\\alpha$ values that imply entanglement.For instance, in order to represent the entangled state of a Whiskertese doorbell, $\\alpha_{01}=\\alpha_{10}=0$ and the other two, $\\alpha_{00}$ and $\\alpha_{11}$, must be equal with their squares adding up to 1.Let’s break this down. In a Whiskertese doorbell, the marbles become the same color after the outer marble is directly observed. If the marbles can only become the same color, then only two possible states are allowed: $\\ket{red, red}$ and $\\ket{blue, blue}$. The first position in each $\\ket{}$ represents the outer marble, and the second position represents the inner marble. The state $\\ket{red, blue}$ is illegal and can never happen within the doorbell apparatus, and so, the probability associated with it is zero. Same for $\\ket{blue, red}$.This means the only non-zero probabilities are the ones associated with $\\ket{red, red}$ and $\\ket{blue, blue}$, and since Whiskertese marbles have a 50-50 chance of becoming either color, the two probabilities must be equal.So here is what that state looks like:\\begin{equation}\\ket{\\phi^+}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\ket{00}+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\ket{11}\\label{eq:bellstate}\\end{equation}The marbles are in what is known as a “Bell state”—named after the physicist John S. Bell, and not because this is the state of the doorbells in Whiskerton. The above equation is what this particular Bell state looks like mathematically, where $\\phi^+$ is a naming convention. 2As you can see, there’s an equal probability for either of the two basis states $\\ket{00},\\ket{11}$ to occur, before the first qubit is measured. But when the first qubit becomes either $\\ket{0}$ or $\\ket{1}$, then the second one has no choice but to follow. In this manner the outcomes are correlated, and the qubits are entangled.At this point it is important to note that this isn’t the only Bell state; there are others. For instance, one of the other Bell states involves the second qubit always becoming the opposite of what the first becomes! But that’s not how the entangled marbles of Whiskerton’s doorbells behave.These two-qubit pairs that are in Bell states are called EPR pairs, after physicists Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen. EPR pairs and entanglement are a valuable resource for theoretical and potential quantum computing applications like quantum cryptography, superdense coding, and quantum teleportation. 3Quick Note on Physical Entangled QubitsPhysically constructing entangled qubits in the lab depends on what you use for qubits. For instance, two photons from a single source, generated in a specific manner, may emerge entangled. There’s no single universal ‘entangler’ the way there is in Whiskerton. And, more accurately, no one actually calls these sources ‘entanglers’! Well, apart from cats.Next: Who Gets the Cardboard Box?Qiskit CodeYou can simulate a Whiskerton doorbell using the following code.

There are other nuances to entanglement as well, and two quantum systems that are very, very far apart must also be what is known as non-local to influence one another, but those are explorations for another day. &#8617; This is what the Bell state looks like mathematically in the computational basis, which is a reference to the type of measurement required to ‘see’ the outcome. There are different bases associated with different types of measurements. &#8617; Teleportation in this context is not the teleportation you find in Star Trek.

Lush feathers — rumored to be shed from a species of vibrantly plumaged birds flying unseen above the clouds, too shy to ever show their faces — iridescent stones from mountains to the west, curiously shaped flowers, and, occasionally, a stray trinket or bauble that had tumbled from an oblivious cat’s pockets as they scurried about their daily business.The cats still spoke of the year Tes’s favorite flower hat disappeared — whisked away by an errant breeze on her way to the sewing shop, vanishing in the instant she reached for it. Two weeks passed and she grew so distraught she offered to reward anyone who could find it with a month’s supply of her famous oceanberry pies. The whole town was stirred into a frenetic, competitive search, as Tes’s pies were not only the tastiest in all of Whiskerton, but also exceedingly rare: she scarcely had time to bake amidst her countless craft projects running in parallel, a privilege of being a retired Councilcat. This scarcity rendered her pies all the more coveted.Remarkably, the hat popped back onto Tes’s own head one humid afternoon as she knitted by the river bordering the town to the east. A bewildered Tes demanded to know where the hat had been all the while, but the hat, naturally, offered no explanation. Always one to honor her word, Tes enjoyed a month of her own oceanberry pies, much to the collective dismay of the townscats.The rarest item of all to appear spontaneously was an unclaimed cardboard box. Every cardboard box in Whiskerton was meticulously accounted for — cats take them very, very seriously indeed.So when an enormous unclaimed cardboard box materialized in the town square, haloed by the bright afternoon sunlight streaming through the branches of the Great Scratching Tree, tremendous excitement ensued.Two of the town’s councilcats, Arya and Poh, were first to arrive in the square, and both immediately laid claim to the box. Naturally, this led to a bit of a scuffle.“Well, you may be older, but I invoke sniffing rights. I sniffed the box first,” Arya declared, whipping her tail decisively.“I saw the box first,” Poh countered.And so the argument continued.A rather substantial crowd began gathering to witness the little spat, and eventually cats started calling out the name of whomever between Arya and Poh they believed had the rightful claim to the box.Arya and Poh ignored them at first, for this was exceedingly serious business. However, as the sunshine began to wane, Arya remembered she had other responsibilities to attend to that day. Namely, her duties at the library. She needed this to be settled quickly and fairly. Even though she knew the box was rightfully hers, she resigned herself to the fact that only an impartial external decision-maker would placate the increasingly animated crowd.She proposed they use a marble, which was her trusty method for choosing between two options.“It is only fair,” Arya insisted.Poh sighed. “Fine. If the marble turns red, the box is mine. If it turns blue, then the box is not yours.”“Oh? Surely you meant if the marble turns blue the box is mine.”“But of course!” Poh could not suppress a cheeky grin.Luna, the most enthusiastic of the onlookers, sprang forward, paws raised. “I will get a marble! Can I get a marble? I will get a marble for you.” She could hardly get the words out, she was wriggling so excitedly. When Arya and Poh nodded their agreement, she practically shook her fur off with her wriggles.Poh offered to escort Luna to the toy station where the townscats kept most of the town’s marbles and other playthings. It was a squat building at the corner of the town square, one of the permanent locations that bordered the square, despite the town’s charming habit of rearranging itself every morning. Luna didn’t particularly enjoy slowing down to walk with the councilcat (she yearned to zoom to the station and back) but the thought of playing an important role in the dispute between Arya and Poh kept her composed.“Do not forget to avoid looking directly at the marble,” Poh instructed her when they reached the doors. If Luna looked at the marble, it would turn red or blue before it ever reached Arya and Poh. He gave her a meaningful nod and returned to the box.While they waited for Luna to fetch a marble, Arya and Poh settled themselves on opposite sides of the box, eyeing each other warily. The onlookers buzzed with fervor, and playful mini-arguments about whom the marble would choose rippled through the gathering.When Luna returned, she placed the marble—without looking at it—between the two contesting councilcats. The marble remained unaffected by the onlookers’ gazes, for they were too distant to influence the marble; one’s eyes must be within ten centimeters of a marble to affect it.The only exception to this rule was a special pair of binoculars that could affect marbles from afar, and was used for things like the glitter machine on Schrödinger Day where one cat could activate the machine by gazing at it from the ground.“Are you ready?” Poh asked Arya. She offered a solemn salute.Then, together, they observed the marble, and to Arya’s dismay, it turned red.“Ha!” said Poh triumphantly. “The box is mine.”Arya frowned, narrowing her eyes at Poh, for she knew he was prone to craftiness, having needed to survive many unfathomable perils out at sea. But her suspicion fled quickly. She trusted the marbles of Whiskerton, and well, she had other matters to attend to. She smiled graciously at the crowd and sauntered away to find a suitable place to lick her paws before diving into her tasks for the evening.Poh leapt into the box to the cheers of the crowd, settled down for a contented nap, and the crowd gradually dispersed.The thing is, Arya had been right to be suspicious. For Poh hadn’t escorted Luna to the toy station doors simply out of politeness. Indeed, avoiding looking at the marble was not the only instruction he’d given her—he had cunningly enlisted her in a little scheme.“You know that ball of silver yarn I have that I don’t allow anyone to touch?”“Oh, yes yes yes!” Luna had been coveting that shiny yarn for months.“Well, a small piece of it shall be yours if you play the tune of Happy Birthday to the marble you select before you bring it to us.” And he slipped a mini flute into Luna’s eager paw.Luna nearly swooned with excitement and darted into the toy station with unbridled enthusiasm.Once inside, she dutifully fetched a marble, then slowly and methodically serenaded it with the tune of Happy Birthday on the flute, taking care to remain farther than ten centimeters away. The marble glimmered with swirling and shifting colors, and it took all of her very limited self-restraint not to be distracted by the glorious chromatic display and stop playing.Now Luna wasn’t much of a musician, but she could manage Happy Birthday to a reasonable standard; all denizens of Whiskerton are trained to play mini flutes as kittens because marbles respond to music.This was one of the most delightful aspects of living in Whiskerton: learning how to make colors dance within the marbles. The musiciancats would host spectacular concerts in the theater, often conducted by Bilito, the most senior of the councilcats and an accomplished organ player.The walls of the open theater were adorned with arrays of marbles positioned far enough away from the musicians on stage and the audience that they remained unaffected by observations. The cats reveled in how colors danced and rippled through the array under the music’s influence, iridescent hues leaping high into the sky like a celestial aurora.The arrangement of the music, the melody, the chords, even the rhythm, all affected the marbles’ probabilities of turning red or blue when directly observed. For the purpose of musical concerts, it was the color journey that mattered and not whether each marble would ultimately appear red or blue upon direct observation. But in the case of Luna’s marble, Poh knew that the tune of Happy Birthday influenced a single marble in such a way that the probability of its turning red became vastly higher than blue.When Luna played Happy Birthday to her chosen marble, she unwittingly ensured that Poh would almost certainly claim the box. Of course, there remained a slight chance the marble would turn blue and Arya would prevail, but Poh was quite willing to take that risk—after all, unpredictability is what makes life in Whiskerton so thoroughly interesting.Clever, clever Poh.And poor, trusting Arya.Chapter 4 Part 2 - Commentary - Quantum Gates and Circuits" }, { "title": "Chapter 4 Part 2 - Commentary - Quantum Gates and Circuits", "url": "/posts/CHAPTER-4-Part-2-Quantum-Gates-and-Circuits/", "categories": "", "tags": "", "date": "2022-06-08 00:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "You already know bits are the fundamental entities that classical computers use to store and process information, and that bits can take on only one value: 0 or 1. But how do the bits know which values to assume?You tell the bits what to do by providing instructions. When you use a computer, you’re essentially issuing commands that cascade down to the fundamental computing components that control the bits and determine whether they’re 0 or 1 at any given instant.Suppose you send a text, “Happy birthday!” to a friend. You open your messaging app, type out each letter, and hit send. Each step involves giving your device instructions. These are high-level instructions that you understand, like ‘type h’ or ‘press enter.’ But your computing device breaks down each of these instructions into machine-level commands, and at the most fundamental level, these instructions control and manipulate strings of bits.These instructions are carried out by logic gates, which perform operations on bits. Different gates can act on single or multiple bits at a time, each performing a specific operation. Combined, they produce the result you want.Similarly, in quantum computing, there are quantum gates that act on qubits.Quantum GatesQuantum gates are how we control qubits – they manipulate the quantum states of qubits. This means changing the probabilities of what you’d get if you measured the qubits.In the Whiskertese marble analogy, a quantum gate changes how likely you are to see red or blue when you directly observe the marble.Quantum CircuitsInstructions can be written out using quantum circuits. A quantum circuit is a model depicting a sequence of quantum gates, measurements, and other actions on your qubits. While it isn’t an actual physical circuit, it represents how the qubits will be manipulated.Here’s an example of what a quantum circuit looks like for three qubits:It looks sort of like a musical score, doesn’t it? Just like sheet music, you read the circuit from left to right. Each horizontal line represents one qubit. The boxes and symbols on those lines are quantum gates, and the gray box at the end of each line represents a measurement. Notice how some quantum gates span multiple lines – these are gates that act on multiple qubits at once.Remember, this quantum circuit is just a visual representation of instructions. Think of it as an abstraction of what will happen in the physical hardware; not a diagram of actual electronic circuits. These instructions make up a quantum algorithm.In Whiskerton, cats implement sequences of quantum gates through music, manipulating the states of their marbles. They know that specific musical notes create specific state changes in the marbles. If you’d like to dive deeper into quantum gates and circuits from a mathematical perspective, read on! Otherwise, head on over to the next page: This is Not the End.Mathematical Representation of Quantum GatesIn chapter 2, you learned that we can represent an arbitrary qubit state using this equation:\\begin{equation}\\ket{\\psi}=\\alpha_{0}\\ket{0}+\\alpha_{1}\\ket{1}\\end{equation}where $\\alpha_{0}$ and $\\alpha_{1}$ are probability amplitudes. These probability amplitudes tell us everything about the state. When a quantum gate changes the state, it changes these $\\alpha$ (pronounced ‘alpha’) values.Let’s call our quantum gate $G$. When we apply $G$ to our initial state $\\ket{\\psi}$, the state changes like this:\\begin{equation} \\alpha_{0}\\ket{0}+\\alpha_{1}\\ket{1} \\rightarrow \\beta_{0}\\ket{0}+\\beta_{1}\\ket{1}\\end{equation}The new $\\beta$ values (pronounced ‘beta’) are the probability amplitudes of our final state.There’s another helpful way to represent quantum states and gates if you know a bit of linear algebra. We can write the probability amplitudes as a column of numbers, or a column vector like so:\\begin{equation} v_\\psi = \\begin{bmatrix} \\alpha_0 \\\\ \\alpha_1 \\end{bmatrix} \\end{equation}This vector is called a state vector. Similarly, we can write any single-qubit quantum gate as a small grid of numbers (a $2 \\times 2$ matrix):\\begin{equation} G = \\begin{bmatrix} a &amp; b \\\\ c &amp; d \\end{bmatrix} \\end{equation}You can then use standard matrix multiplication to determine the resulting state:\\begin{equation} \\begin{bmatrix} a &amp; b \\\\ c &amp; d \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\alpha_0 \\\\ \\alpha_1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\beta_0 \\\\ \\beta_1 \\end{bmatrix} \\end{equation}Let’s look at two specific examples of commonly used gates!NOT GateThe quantum NOT gate is similar to its classical cousin. In classical computing, a NOT gate flips a bit from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0. The quantum version does something similar – it swaps the probability amplitudes for $\\ket{0}$ and $\\ket{1}$. This means if your qubit was more likely to give you 0 when measured, after the NOT gate it becomes more likely to give you 1, and vice versa.Here’s what the NOT gate does:\\begin{equation} \\ket{0} \\rightarrow \\ket{1}\\end{equation}\\begin{equation} \\ket{1} \\rightarrow \\ket{0}\\end{equation}\\begin{equation} \\alpha_{0}\\ket{0}+\\alpha_{1}\\ket{1} \\rightarrow \\alpha_{1}\\ket{0}+\\alpha_{0}\\ket{1}\\end{equation}We can write the NOT gate as this matrix (also called the X gate or Pauli X gate):\\begin{equation} X = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\\\ 1 &amp; 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\end{equation}Try multiplying this matrix yourself with these three different states to see how it works:\\begin{equation} \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} , \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} , \\begin{bmatrix} \\alpha_0 \\\\ \\alpha_1 \\end{bmatrix} \\end{equation}Hadamard GateNot all quantum gates have classical analogs like the NOT gate – in fact, most do not. The Hadamard gate is one of these uniquely quantum gates, and it’s arguably one of the most important in quantum computing. Many quantum algorithms rely on it for initializing qubit states. What makes it so special? When applied to either $\\ket{0}$ or $\\ket{1}$, it creates an equally weighted superposition.Sound familiar? It’s just like the marbles of Whiskerton that are by default in an equally weighted superposition of red and blue!Here’s what the Hadamard gate does:\\begin{equation} \\ket{0} \\rightarrow \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\ket{0}+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\ket{1}\\end{equation} \\begin{equation} \\ket{1} \\rightarrow \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\ket{0}-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\ket{1}\\end{equation} \\begin{equation} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\ket{0}+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\ket{1} \\rightarrow \\ket{0}\\end{equation} \\begin{equation} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\ket{0}-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\ket{1} \\rightarrow \\ket{1}\\end{equation}Those $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$ values mean there’s a 50-50 chance of measuring either 0 or 1. Notice that sometimes there’s a minus sign. While this doesn’t change the probabilities, it creates something called phase that we’ll explore in a future chapter. It’s like giving our marbles a special kind of spin.Here’s the Hadamard gate as a matrix:\\begin{equation} H = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\\\ 1 &amp; -1 \\end{bmatrix} \\end{equation}Try working through the matrix multiplication yourself to see how it creates these transformations.An important note: the equally weighted single-qubit superposition states are so significant in quantum computing they get their own special symbols:\\begin{align}\\ket{+}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\ket{0}+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\ket{1}\\\\ket{-}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\ket{0}-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\ket{1}\\\\end{align}Geometric Representation of QubitsIf you prefer a more visual mathematical representation, perhaps a geometric representation of a qubit state would be helpful. An arbitrary state $\\psi$ can be written in terms of sines and cosines, such that the probability amplitudes are $\\alpha_{0} =\\cos{\\theta}$ and $\\alpha_{1} =\\sin{\\theta}$:\\begin{equation}\\ket{\\psi}=\\cos{\\theta}\\ket{0}+\\sin{\\theta}\\ket{1}\\end{equation}This is a valid representation—remember that the sum of probabilities must always add up to 11.\\begin{equation}\\alpha_{0}^2+\\alpha_{1}^2=\\cos^2{\\theta}+\\sin^2{\\theta}=1\\end{equation}As a result, the arbitrary state $\\ket{\\psi}$ can be visually represented on a unit circle (that is, a circle of radius 1) like so:The green vector is the arbitrary state and the two axes correspond to the basis states $\\ket{0}$ and $\\ket{1}$.If the angle $\\theta$ is 45 degrees, you get the $\\ket{+}$ state:With this representation, you can easily think of a quantum gate as acting on a qubit state, such that the corresponding vector moves around this circle according to changes in $\\theta$.It is important to note that this is not a complete representation of a qubit, because it doesn’t take into account that additional parameter I called ‘phase’ earlier. When we cover phase, you will encounter a more complete representation in three dimensions, called the Bloch sphere.Running Quantum CircuitsYou now understand that quantum gates manipulate the probabilities within a quantum state. Thus a sequence of quantum gates in a quantum circuit or a quantum algorithm manipulates state probabilities. Or, to phrase it a different way, quantum algorithms manipulate the probabilities associated with each possible outcome.You may naturally wonder: if there are probabilities associated with the results, isn’t there a chance you may get an incorrect or undesirable result? And you’d be right!This is why, unlike classical circuits, we run quantum circuits multiple times and gather the results as statistics. Each time you run a circuit is called a shot and the more shots you run, the more accurate your results will be.Let’s take a look at a circuit with a single qubit for which, after application of certain gates, it has a 4% chance of yielding 0 and a 96% chance of yielding 1 upon measurement.This makes use of the X gate shown above, and another gate called the Rotation X ($R_X$) gate with an angle of: $\\frac{\\pi}{8}$ 2Given how likely we are to get the result 1, if we associate blue with 0 and red with 1, we have one of the possible quantum circuit representations of Luna playing Happy Birthday—remember that she manipulated the marble to be more likely to be red after observation. Quick disclaimer about the Chapter 4 story: If you’re wondering about the 10 cm distance rule, this is solely a whimsical storytelling device representing quantum measurements. In reality, quantum measurements occur through physical interactions that cause quantum states to settle into one of their definite basis states. Refer to Chapter 2 for a description of quantum measurements.Next: This is Not the EndQiskit CodeIf you weren’t familiar with quantum gates and circuits prior to this chapter, and would like to try coding them with Qiskit, return to the Qiskit sections in Chapter 2 Part 2 and Chapter 3 Part 2 to try your hands at coding circuits.Otherwise, try to code Luna’s Happy Birthday circuit as an exercise! This is a fundamental trigonometric identity. &#8617; This $R_X$ gate rotates the qubit’s state around the x-axis by an angle of $\\frac{\\pi}{8}$. It also introduces a phase. We’ll see a visual representation of this rotation later. &#8617; " }, { "title": "This is Not the End", "url": "/posts/This-is-not-the-end/", "categories": "", "tags": "", "date": "2022-06-07 00:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "Do you want to hear about how Arya sent Blade a birthday gift via quantum teleportation, and other stories about the townscats of Whiskerton?The good news is the stories don’t end here, this is only the beginning.This is the online, living release of Quantum Kittens; we are slowly and steadily working towards completing the book by releasing one chapter at a time!If you’d like to be notified about new chapter releases, please submit this form and select the checkbox to recieve notitications.This book is also part of Radha’s experimentation with creative approaches to education, such as game-based learning and learning through storytelling.
