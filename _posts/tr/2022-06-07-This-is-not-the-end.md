Do you want to hear about how Arya sent Blade a birthday gift via quantum teleportation, and other stories about the townscats of Whiskerton?


The good news is the stories don't end here, this is only the beginning. 

This is the online, living release of *Quantum Kittens*; we are slowly and steadily working towards completing the book by releasing one chapter at a time!

If you'd like to be notified about new chapter releases, please submit [this form](https://airtable.com/shrTIeiVZWHm2OTVw) and select the checkbox to recieve notitications.

This book is also part of Radha's experimentation with creative approaches to education, such as game-based learning and learning through storytelling. (Want to know more about game-based learning and IBM Quantum's foray into this space through the program Radha led?
